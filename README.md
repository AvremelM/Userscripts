##Userscripts:


* [Duolingo All Scripts](https://github.com/HodofHod/Userscripts/raw/master/duo-all-scripts.user.js)
  * Like Duolingo Mods, except auto-updating. It loads the newest version of Duolingo Mods from github.com,
    so that you never have to update again.
* [Duolingo Mods (all scripts)](https://github.com/HodofHod/Userscripts/raw/master/duo-mods.user.js)
  * Loads all the below scripts, plus will become a place for me to put smaller mods. If you don't want all the scripts, you can disable whichever you like from the Duolingo Settings page. (Neat, huh?)
* [Duolingo Lesson Review](https://github.com/HodofHod/Userscripts/raw/master/duolingo-lesson-review.user.js)
  * Allows you to go back and review problems during lessons
* [Duolingo Easy Accents](https://github.com/HodofHod/Userscripts/raw/master/duo-easy-accents.user.js)
  * Type special characters just by using alt. No need for alt codes, new keyboard layouts, or clicking
* [Duolingo Comment Links Accents](https://github.com/HodofHod/Userscripts/raw/master/duo-comment-links.user.js)
  * Turns the timestamp into a direct link for every comment in Duolingo's Dicussions
